# Future Plans #

This page is a discussion based wiki in which everybody can suggest features that should be implemented in upcoming versions of the dateslider framework.

Feel also free to think about uses of the framework to applications other than date dialogs. Maybe this will be the basis for a whole set of widgets that can be used for a great variety of tasks.

## Design ##
I am not to a 100% satisfied with the design of the slider. It might be nice to have it look more modern, or pure, or whatever.

## Core ##
Maybe, but only maybe, it might be useful to have the opportunity to include **snapping** to a `ScrollLayout`. This means that when one bar is scrolled, this scroll movement will always finish at the center of a particular time unit.

## Further Widgets ##
If you have some ideas, state them here!

## Various ##
turn the DateSlider into an intent to make it easily accessible for multiple applications
